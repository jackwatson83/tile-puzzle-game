# Tile Puzzle Game
A small puzzle game I developed to try out a mechanic I was interested in - remembering and replaying player movement.

The idea for this game is to simultaneously activate two pressure plates by standing on them.
As there is only one controllable player object, the game remembers the last x moves you made, and repeats them while you "program" another
set of moves. Completing the puzzle requires you to be stood on a pressure plate on your last move, while the other pressure plate is being
pressed by your "old" self.
